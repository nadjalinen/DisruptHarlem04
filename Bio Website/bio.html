		<p>My name is Nadja Linen. I am 24 years of age and live in the Bronx, New York. I am working towards my Bachelors degree in Web Design and Interactive Media. I have some exerience since I am graduate of the Art Institute of New York City and have my Associates Degree. So what I am hoping to accomplish in this class is to re-learn and improve on the skills I already have. I do have a talented eye for design regarding digital art and typography. I'm proficient in Adobe Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, and Dreamweaver as well as Microsoft Office. Having created several graphic designs, typography art, and a few websites, I hope to add more to my profile. And aside from these skills, my hobbies include writing short stories and poetry as well as creating flyers for events happening at my church, Thessalonia Worship Center. I also do media during Sunday services. I have also recently gotten into a new hobby, doing audio readings on Youtube. I second that up woth reviewing shows and movies, resulting in me having two YouTube channels.</p>
